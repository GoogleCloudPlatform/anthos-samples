## Install an Anthos on bare metal cluster of type 'hybrid'

This sample shows you how to setup an **hybrid** Anthos clusters on bare metal
in High Availability (HA) mode using Compute Engine Virtual Machines (VMs). The
[install_hybrid_cluster](/anthos-bm-gcp-bash/install_hybrid_cluster.sh) script
encapsulates all the steps required to setup the Compute Engine VMs and to
trigger the installation of Anthos on bare metal. Follow the
[Try Anthos clusters on bare metal on Compute Engine VMs](https://cloud.google.com/anthos/clusters/docs/bare-metal/latest/try/gce-vms) guide for a step by step
explanation of all the steps included in this script.


### Prerequisites

- A workstation with access to the Internet _(i.e. Google Cloud APIs)_ with the following installed
  - [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
  - [Google Cloud SDK (gcloud CLI)](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install)
- A [Google Cloud Project](https://console.cloud.google.com/cloud-resource-manager?_ga=2.187862184.1029435410.1614837439-1338907320.1614299892) _(in which the resources for the setup will be provisioned)_
- The gcloud CLI must be [authenticated to Google Cloud and be configured to use
  the Google Cloud Project](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/init) you intend to use
---
### Quickstart

1. Clone this repo into the workstation from where the rest of this guide will
   be followed.

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/anthos-samples
    cd anthos-samples/anthos-bm-gcp-bash
    ```

2. Setup environment variables.
    ```sh
    export PROJECT_ID=<GCP_PROJECT_TO_USE>
    export ZONE=<GCP_ZONE_TO_USE>
    ```

3. Run the installation script.

    ```sh
    bash install_hybrid_cluster.sh
    ```
    ```sh
    # expected output
    ...
    ...
    ...
    âœ… Successfully set up SSH access from admin workstation to cluster node VMs.
