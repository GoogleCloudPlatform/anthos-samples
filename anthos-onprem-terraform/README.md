## Install Anthos onPrem clusters using Terraform

This directory hosts samples and how-to's for installing Anthos onPrem clusters
_(i.e. Anthos on bare metal and Anthos on VMware)_ using the
`google_gkeonprem-*` resources of the canonical
[Google Cloud Terraform provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/latest/docs).


All the samples here, first **emulates** a bare metal infrastucture using
Compute Engine (GCE) VMs. It is on this imaginary bare metal environment the
clusters are installed. Thus, as a prestep to all the guides here, you will see
a step for provisioning the bare metal insfrastructure. If you have your own
bare metal infrastructure, you can skip that section and adjust the sample to
suit your environment.
