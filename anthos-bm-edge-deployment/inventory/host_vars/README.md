# Layout

There are 3 locations setup for this configuration. Store 1, 2 and 4 (no store #3)

> NOTE: Having variables without matching inventory is OK (ie, you only have 3 machines, just setup inventory for `cnuc-1..3` or `cnuc-1..3`)

### Format
> `store-X-Y` - X=store number, Y=machine in cluster group
