### Setup the bare metal infrastructure

1. Clone this repo into the workstation from where the rest of this guide will
   be followed and move into the `anthos-bm-apigee` sample directory:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/anthos-sample
    cd anthos-bm-apigee
    ```

1. Update the `terraform.tfvars.sample` file to include variables specific to
   your environment:

    ```sh
    project_id                    = "<GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT_ID>"
    region                        = "<GOOGLE_CLOUD_REGION_TO_USE>"
    zone                          = "<GOOGLE_CLOUD_ZONE_TO_USE>"
    credentials_file              = "<PATH_TO_GOOGLE_CLOUD_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_FILE>"
    #gcp_login_accounts           = ["<GCP_ACCOUNT_1>", <GCP_ACCOUNT_2>, <GCP_ACCOUNT_3>]
    username                      = tfadmin
    ```

    Uncomment the `gce_vm_service_account` if you want to login to your cluster
    using the Google email account that is associated with your GCP Project. You
    can add multiple GCP accounts to enable access to multiple users.

    An example of these configuration looks like this below:

    ```sh
    project_id                     = "anthos-bm-example1"
    region                         = "us-central1"
    zone                           = "us-central1-a"
    credentials_file               = "/usr/home/keyfiles/anthos-bm-owner.json"
    gcp_login_accounts             = ["alex@gmail.com"]
    username                       = tfadmin
    ```

1. Rename the `variables` file to the default name used by Terraform:
    > **Note:** You can skip this step if you run `terraform apply` with the `-var-file` flag

    ```sh
    mv terraform.tfvars.sample terraform.tfvars
    ```

1. Initialize the Terraform against the script ([main.tf](/anthos-bm-apigee/main.tf))
   for this sample:

    ```sh
    terraform init
    ```

1. Create a _Terraform_ execution plan:

    ```sh
    terraform plan
    ```

1. Apply the changes described in the _Terraform_ script:

    ```sh
    terraform apply
    ```

    > **Note:** When prompted to confirm the Terraform plan, type 'Yes' and enter

    ***The `apply` command sets up the Compute Engine VM based bare metal infrastructure. This can take a few minutes (approx. 3-5 mins) for the entire bare-metal cluster to be setup.***

    Upon a successfull run you will see an output similar the one below:

    ```sh
    admin_vm_ssh = <<EOT
    ################################################################################
    ##              AnthosBM on Google Compute Engine VM with Terraform           ##

    EOT
    ```

### Deploy an Anthos cluster and Install Apigee

After the Terraform execution completes you are ready to deploy an Anthos on
bare metal cluster into the provisioned VMs.

1. SSH into the admin host _(you can this command printed as part of the Terraform output)_

    ```sh
    gcloud compute ssh tfadmin@apigee-cluster-abm-ws0-001 --project=<YOUR_PROJECT> --zone=<YOUR_ZONE>
    ```

2. Install the Anthos on bare metal cluster

    ```sh
    export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/home/tfadmin/terraform-sa.json && \
    sudo -E ./run_initialization_checks.sh && \
    sudo -E bmctl create config -c apigee-cluster && \
    sudo -E cp ~/apigee-cluster.yaml bmctl-workspace/apigee-cluster && \
    sudo -E bmctl create cluster -c apigee-cluster
    ```

3. Install  Apigee into the cluster

    ```sh
    ./install_apigee.sh
    ```

    > **Note:** You may see continuous errors printed on screen such as
    > `ERROR: gcloud crashed (KeyError): 'organizations'` during the
    > installation. These indicate a continuous check being run on a loop until
    > a certain condition is being met. Please don't cancel the installation and
    > wait for the checks to eventually reconcile and proceed.
---

Running the commands from the Terraform output starts setting up a new Anthos
cluster. This includes checking the initialization state of the nodes, creating
the admin and user clusters and also registering the cluster with Google Cloud
using [Connect](https://cloud.google.com/anthos/multicluster-management/connect/overview).
Once, the cluster has been created successfully, the [install_apigee.sh](../resources/install_apigee.sh)
script will trigger the Apigee installation. The whole setup can take up to 30
minutes. You see the following output as the cluster is being created:

> **Note:** The logs for checks on node initialization has been left out.
> They appear before the following logs from Anthos setup

### Verify Apigee Installation

You can find your cluster's `kubeconfig` file on the admin machine in the
`bmctl-workspace` directory. To verify your deployment, complete the following
steps.

1. SSH into the admin host _(if you are not already inside it)_:

    ```sh
    # You can copy the command from the output of Terraform run from the previous step
    gcloud compute ssh tfadmin@apigee-cluster-abm-ws0-001 --project=<YOUR_PROJECT> --zone=<YOUR_ZONE>
    ```

1. Set the `KUBECONFIG` environment variable to run `kubectl` commands on the
   cluster.

    ```sh
    export CLUSTER_ID=apigee-cluster
    export KUBECONFIG=$HOME/bmctl-workspace/$CLUSTER_ID/$CLUSTER_ID-kubeconfig
    kubectl get nodes
    ```

    You should see the nodes of the cluster printed, _similar_ to the output below:

    ```sh
    NAME          STATUS   ROLES    AGE   VERSION
    apigee-cluster-abm-cp1-001   Ready    master   17m   v1.18.6-gke.6600
    apigee-cluster-abm-w1-001    Ready    <none>   14m   v1.18.6-gke.6600
    apigee-cluster-abm-w2-001    Ready    <none>   14m   v1.18.6-gke.6600
    apigee-cluster-abm-w3-001    Ready    <none>   14m   v1.18.6-gke.6600
    ```

1. You can get the istio ingress gateway IP by running the following command:

    ```sh
    kubectl get svc -n istio-system
    ```
    ```sh
    NAME                   TYPE           CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)                                      AGE
    istio-ingressgateway   LoadBalancer   172.26.232.85    10.200.0.51   15021:30217/TCP,80:32733/TCP,443:32307/TCP   13m
    istiod                 ClusterIP      172.26.232.33    <none>        15010/TCP,15012/TCP,443/TCP,15014/TCP        13m
    istiod-asm-1129-3      ClusterIP      172.26.232.186   <none>        15010/TCP,15012/TCP,443/TCP,15014/TCP        13m
    ```

    `EXTERNAL_IP` of istio-ingressgateway is the endpoint for API proxies
    deployed on Apigee. For example, if a mockservice with resource path of
    `/mockservice` is deployed on Apigee, it can be accessed via
    `https://$EXTERNAL_IP.nip.io/mockservice`. The `EXTERNAL_IP` here will be an
    IP on the VxLAN network that creates the L2-network between the GCE VMs.

### Access with UI via the GCP console

During the setup process, an Apigee Organization is created and you can access
the [Apigee UI](https://cloud.google.com/apigee/docs/api-platform/fundamentals/ui-overview)
by logging into [apigee.google.com](https://apigee.google.com) with your GCP
Credentials.

### Cleanup

#### 1. Cleanup resources. You can cleanup the cluster setup in two ways: <!-- omit in toc -->

- (1) Delete the entire Google Cloud project [from the console]((https://console.cloud.google.com/cloud-resource-manager))

- (2) Using Terraform
  - First deregister the cluster before deleting all the resources created by Terraform

    ```sh
    # SSH into the admin host
    gcloud compute ssh tfadmin@apigee-cluster-abm-ws0-001 --project=<YOUR_PROJECT> --zone=<YOUR_ZONE>

    # Reset the cluster
    export CLUSTER_ID=apigee-cluster
    export KUBECONFIG=$HOME/bmctl-workspace/$CLUSTER_ID/$CLUSTER_ID-kubeconfig

    sudo bmctl reset --cluster $CLUSTER_ID

    # logout of the admin host
    exit
    ```

    - Then, use Terraform to delete all resources.

    ```sh
    # to be run from the root directory of this repo
    terraform destroy --auto-approve
    ```

  - Deregister cluster from the Cloud hub membership.

#### 2. Delete Apigee Organization <!-- omit in toc -->

  ```sh
  gcloud alpha apigee organizations delete <YOUR_PROJECT>
  ```

#### 3. Clean Temporary files <!-- omit in toc -->

```sh
rm -fr ./resources/.temp
rm -fr terraform.tfstate
```
